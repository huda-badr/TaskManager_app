Abstract 
Most task management applications do not consider personal and emotional 
aspects of productivity, which frustrates users and makes them disengaged. The 
Personal Task Manager fills in that gap by introducing mood-driven task prioritization, 
a personal milestone tracker, and gamification through progress rewards. Unlike 
existing tools, it dynamically adjusts task suggestions based on emotional input, 
helping users stay productive even during stressful or low-energy times. It integrates 
milestone tracking and rewards to ensure motivation, without making the process 
overcomplicated or hard to use. For users who balance daily tasks with big-picture 
goals, this app is the redefinition of task management, offering intuitive and 
emotionally intelligent ways to be productive.

II. 
Importance of the Project 
• Addressing Task Management Challenges: Studies show that 70% of users 
abandon task management apps due to limited customization and lack of 
engagement. Our app fills this gap by offering dynamic features like mood
driven prioritization and gamification. 
• Target Audience: Designed specifically for busy professionals, students, and 
goal-oriented individuals, our app provides tailored task management 
solutions for diverse needs. 
• Societal Benefits: By incorporating features that reduce stress and improve 
mental well-being, the app has the potential to positively impact users' daily 
lives and productivity. 
• Boosting Productivity: Adaptive AI and mood-based prioritization ensure users 
focus on tasks they are most capable of completing, leading to better time 
management and reduced procrastination. 
• Unique Features for Engagement: Unlike traditional task managers, our app 
uses gamification and habit-based task suggestions to keep users motivated 
and consistent.

III. Novelty of Our Work 
• Competitors (like Todoist, Microsoft To Do, Omni Focus, etc..) often focus on 
productivity but lack unique features like customizable and easy to use 
interface, unique tools, adaptive task scheduling, etc. 
• The app stands out by incorporating features like: 
o Habit-Based Task Suggestions 
o Mood-Driven Task Prioritization 
o Personal Milestone Tracker 
o Gamification with Progress Rewards 
o Chatbot AI

IV. Contributions Compared to Existing Work 
• Merging simplicity and functionality for a personal, non-enterprise audience. 
• Reducing cognitive load by offering adaptive task suggestions (e.g., 
categorizing tasks as morning/evening). 
• Technical Contributions: Our app introduces mood analysis combined with 
adaptive task scheduling—a feature currently missing in most personal task 
managers. 
• User-Centric Innovations: By seamlessly integrating gamification, mood
driven task sorting, and habit-based suggestions, the app ensures high user 
engagement and retention. 
• Practical Use Cases:  
o Example: when a user feels fatigued, the app dynamically suggests 
lighter tasks like "organize files" instead of more demanding ones like 
"write a report," ensuring task progress regardless of energy levels.

V. Major Features 
1. Task Creation and Management  
• Description: Users can create and manage tasks by specifying 
their titles, descriptions, deadlines, and priority levels (high, 
medium, low). Tasks can be categorized automatically based on 
keywords (e.g., “work”, “shopping”, “home”) to improve 
organization and make it easier for users to track specific types of 
tasks. This feature ensures that users can efficiently keep track of 
multiple tasks and categorize them for easier management.  
2. Time Management Tools  
• Description: The app includes built-in time management features, 
such as a Pomodoro timer and a focus mode. The Pomodoro 
timer allows users to work in intervals (typically 25 minutes of 
focused work followed by a short break), helping users stay 
productive. Additionally, the app tracks how long tasks take to 
complete, and based on historical data, the app can predict the 
time required for similar future tasks using a regression model. 
This feature enhances productivity by encouraging time 
management and providing valuable insights into task completion 
rates.  
3. Mood and Productivity Tracking  
• Description: Users can log their mood and productivity levels 
throughout the day. The app tracks the correlation between users' 
moods and task completion efficiency, helping them identify 
patterns (e.g., which types of tasks are easier to complete when 
feeling happy or energized). So when they enter the application, it 
asked if he/she want to enter the mood they are currently in and 
they choose one of the present sentiments in the list, they get a 
recommended task. Additionally, machine learning models can 
be used to analyze how certain tasks impact moods, providing 
insights into optimal task assignment based on emotional states.  
4. Personalization and Customization  
• Description: The app allows users to personalize their experience 
by offering options to customize themes, such as choosing color 
schemes or layouts. This feature is aimed at making the app feel 
more tailored to individual preferences, improving user satisfaction 
5 | P a g e 
and engagement. Personalization makes the app more appealing 
by providing flexibility and a unique experience for each user.  
5. Gamification and Analytics  
• Description: To enhance user engagement and motivation, the app 
incorporates gamification elements. Users earn badges and 
rewards for completing tasks or achieving productivity milestones. 
The app also provides basic productivity analytics in the form of 
charts or graphs to help users visualize their task completion rates 
over time. These visualizations help users see their progress, stay 
motivated, and identify areas for improvement in their workflow.  
6. Offline Functionality  
• Description: Users can continue managing their tasks offline by 
storing data locally on their device. Tasks and updates are synced 
with the cloud once the device reconnects to the internet. This 
ensures that users can remain productive even without a stable 
internet connection, a critical feature for users on the go or in areas 
with limited connection.  
7. Chatbot AI Assistant 
• Description: The app includes an AI-powered chatbot to assist 
users with their tasks. If users need help or guidance, they can 
interact with the chatbot in natural language.

XI. Conclusion 
As of now, our capstone project remains in the planning and early 
development stages. We have outlined the key features of our task manager 
application, focusing on aspects like adaptive AI, gamification, offline-first 
design, and cross-platform consistency. Additionally, we have conducted an 
analysis of existing task management apps to identify gaps and opportunities for 
improvement. 
So far, we have worked on the initial setup, including creating the database, 
designing the login and signup pages, and developing the main page with a splash 
screen. However, the core functionalities—such as task creation, AI-powered 
suggestions, and productivity tracking—are yet to be implemented. 
While there is still a significant amount of work to be done, the foundation has 
been set, and we are prepared to move forward with development and 
implementation in the coming weeks.
